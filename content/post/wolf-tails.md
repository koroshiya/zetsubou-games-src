        "Moving far away from civilization, you hoped to live a life of solitude in a snowy cabin. Just as you begin to adapt to your peaceful new life, you discover an intruder; a wolf-girl, alone and shivering in your storeroom. Fearful for her life, you take the girl in for the night, offering her a place to stay until she recovers.",
        "Once she has recovered, however, the wolf-girl shows no sign of leaving. In fact, she seems quite content to move in.",
        "Soon after, yet another wolf-girl shows up, loudly accusing the “Princess” of running away from her duties to the pack. She wants nothing more than to bring the Princess back home with her and restore order - and despite your best wishes, you're now stuck in the middle of it."
