story = [
        "In Catch Canvas, you start your adventure as you arrive at your uncle's cabin. Your uncle, a world-renowned artist, has agreed to take you under his wing and help push your art to the next level. Under his tutelage, your work may even be put on display at a prestigious, upcoming art exhibition, known for the instant fame it brings anyone lucky enough to participate.",
        "After your arrival, however, you discover that it won't be so straightforward. Your uncle is nowhere to be found, and he has left you with the task of getting three young girls, all aspiring artists, to finish their Mars sculptures in a mere two weeks; or no exhibition for you! Worse yet, the girls are highly unmotivated, and have no desire to listen to you, a complete stranger.",
        "Can you help the girls finish their sculptures before the deadline?"
