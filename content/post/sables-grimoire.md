story = [
	"When Sable is accepted into Amadronia Magic Academy, a prestigious academy famous for its resources and curriculum, he believes that he has crossed an important milestone in his life.",
	"As an aspiring magic researcher, not to mention one of the few pure-blooded human beings capable of using magic, Sable has high hopes for his time at Amadronia. His dream of becoming a world-renowned magic researcher is finally within his grasp, and with the assistance of the much-lauded teaching staff at Amadronia, he is sure that the next few years of his life will be as productive as they are enlightening.",
	"Unfortunately for Sable, his first day at Amadronia quickly proves to him that this will not be the case.",
	"Arrogant elves, a ravenous rokurokubi, a poison-tongued mandragora, a pyromaniac dragon, unenthusiastic teachers - Amadronia is nothing like Sable envisioned. The students in his class are unruly, his \"teacher\" has no interest in teaching, the principal wilfully breaks academy rules, and it seems like everywhere he turns, Sable finds one more reason to doubt Amadronia's proud legacy.",
	"Will Sable manage to survive at this clearly dysfunctional academy? Or will he, like so many others, leave Amadronia feeling utterly disillusioned?"

characters = [
	"sg/characters/sable.jpg",
	"Sable",
	"Sable is an aspiring magic researcher who often allows his obsession to get the best of him. To Sable, sleep and food are a waste of time, and other human beings are mere distractions. All that matters is his research. While Sable is typically disinterested in other people, demi-humans and other prominent mages are an exception. Sable is interested in demi-humans to the point where some might find his fascination downright creepy.",
	
	"sg/characters/drakan.jpg",
	"Drakan",
	"An easygoing half-dragon girl who takes very little in life seriously. All she wants to do is have fun, and make friends. Despite her straightforward and assertive personality, Drakan is easy to get along with, forgiving, and will happily go with the flow. Being a half-dragon, Drakan is frightfully powerful, and she possesses a vast amount of knowledge which scholars would kill to get their hands on.",
	
	"sg/characters/lisha.jpg",
	"Lisha",
	"\"Lisha\", whose real name no human can pronounce successfully, is serious to a fault. She takes great pride in her conduct, heritage, grades, and every other aspect of her life. Lisha is also an extraordinary mage. Having lived for eons among her own kind, she possesses talent rarely found even among elves. The only thing Lisha seems to be incapable of is making friends.",
	
	"sg/characters/eth.jpg",
	"Eth",
	"As a mandragora, Eth often moves and speaks at a slower pace than those around her. She also has trouble keeping up in lessons, and is dangerously close to being expelled. Even so, Eth makes no effort to change herself. She is quite aware of her limitations, and ultimately, she doesn't care. To Eth, Amadronia is simply a place to learn about human culture, and to make friends.",
	
	"sg/characters/tix.jpg",
	"Tix",
	"Tix may be a cheerful, happy person, but she is no pushover. Armed with a tongue as sharp as her mind, Tix will rarely hesitate to say what she's thinking. Contrary to her small size, Tix specializes in physical enhancement magic. Her tiny arms wield significantly more power than those of humans three times her size. Tix bears complicated feelings towards human beings, due to her species' reliance on mankind.",
	
	"sg/characters/rei.jpg",
	"Rei",
	"Rei is a fun-loving and happy girl who makes friends easily, and seldom holds a grudge. Sheâ€™s also quite air-headed, and a bit of a dunce, not to mention a complete and utter glutton. Her only redeeming trait as a mage is her abnormal talent for spiritual magic, aka. healing magic. Rei aspires to become a nurse or a priestess, and to spend her life healing others, just as the rest of her family have for generations.",
	
	"sg/characters/hel.jpg",
	"Hel",
	"Hel is a romanticist who often acts without thinking. Androgynous in appearance, Hel pursues men and women alike, and she isn't one to take no for an answer. Hel is neither strong nor motivated. To her, magic is merely a tool which allows her to hit on hotties of all races and genders indiscriminately. Hel excels at altering her appearance to match the ideals of whoever she is speaking to, and can trick even the strongest of minds into falling for her.",
	
	"sg/characters/narm.jpg",
	"Narm",
	"Narm dreams of becoming a rune knight - a warrior who wields both magic and steel in order to defend innocent civilians from harm. Unfortunately, Narm's talent for magic is somewhat lacking. Compared to the demi-humans around him, he is a novice at best. Narm compensated for this by actively seeking techniques that even he can use, and people who will join him as brothers in arms.",

	"sg/characters/jorou.jpg",
	"Jorou",
	"Cursed with an appearance which frightens others, Jorou has spent most of her life suffering at the hands of humans. Despite the pain she has endured, however, Jorou still chooses to see the best in others, and reaches out to people whenever possible. Jorou is knowledgeable, reliable, and always happy to assist. If you ever need help with matters pertaining to magic or demi-humans, Jorou is the right person to ask.",
	
	"sg/characters/raphael.jpg",
	"Raphael",
	"Raphael is the academy's nurse. She's a literal angel, or so she claims, and she acts like one in every conceivable manner. And yet, students and teachers alike avoid her like the plague. Not because they usually only see her when they're injured, but because Raphael possesses an unnatural fascination with death. How is it that such a kind, lovely woman inspires so much fear in those around her?",
	
	"sg/characters/eris.jpg",
	"Eris",
	"Eris is a succubus who abuses her powers on a daily basis, frequently manipulating students into doing her bidding. She is also lazy, unenthusiastic, and has been cautioned many times about engaging in inappropriate relationships with students. Some say she used to be a kind, caring teacher, who loved her job, and wanted the best for her students."
