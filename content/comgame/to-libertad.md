	"As she begins to run towards freedom, however, Ada's hopes are quickly dashed. A trio of slavers catch up to her, cornering her in an alleyway and threatening to put her through hell once more before killing her. Realizing herself that she has no chance of defeating them, Ada closes her eyes, surrendering herself as she braces for her final moments.",
	"But is it not Ada who is fated to die that day.",

	"Thus begins the journey of Ada and Martha, two women being pursued by slavers, assassins, and even monsters. Will the two make it to Libertad in one piece? And when the time comes for them to part ways, how will Ada and Martha react?"
