story = [
	"Kai and Chris have been best friends for as long as they can remember. They went to the same schools, they've been in the same classes year after year, they have the same hobbies, the same interests, and could be said to be inseparable.",
	"Even as they aged, this did not change. Contrary to the usual degrees of separation prompted by puberty, the two remained close, and largely ignored the gender divide. Sports, video games, sleepovers, and even dirty magazines; no matter what the topic or event, Chris and Kai would laugh it all off together, enjoying each other's company without any consideration for how they might appear to others, or what problems they might encounter.",
	"Unfortunately, those care-free days are now coming to an end. Kai and Chris aren't kids anymore. They're both 18 year old heterosexuals of the opposite sex, and they can't keep pretending that they're just a couple of friends hanging out. Something is going to change, whether they're ready for it or not.",
	"Chris has been aware of this for a long time now, but Kai is only just starting to realize what's going on around him. The crushes he's had on other girls have faded, and it's finally dawned on him that his best friend is a member of the opposite sex. Tomboy or not, Chris's soft skin and adorable face make Kai's heart pound so loud that he can hear it. He's developing feelings for his best friend, or perhaps only just now realized what he's felt all along.",
	"Kai has fallen for Chris, and he has no idea what to do.",
	"\"Is this feeling real? Or am I just thinking this way because she's nice to me? And what about those other girls I used to like? Did those feelings fade, or did I never care about them from the beginning?\" These questions begin to hound Kai as his maturing brain shows him a side of Chris he never noticed before. He begins to realize that her roughhousing and playful teasing could be seen as flirting, and that the jokes she makes about the two of them someday becoming a couple aren't really jokes at all.",
	"Will Kai make one more last-ditch effort to escape his confused feelings and date the girl he most recently had a crush on? Or will he accept that the friend right by his side since childhood was the perfect woman for him all along?",
	"No matter what actions Kai takes, Chris, in her justified frustration, has made one thing clear: tomboys need love too!"
