story = [
	"Kai and Chris have been best friends for as long as they can remember. They went to the same schools, they've been in the same classes year after year, they have the same hobbies, the same interests, and could be said to be inseparable.",
	"Even as they aged, this did not change. Contrary to the usual degrees of separation prompted by puberty, the two remained close, and largely ignored the gender divide. Sports, video games, sleepovers, and even dirty magazines; no matter what the topic or event, Chris and Kai would laugh it all off together, enjoying each other's company without any consideration for how they might appear to others, or what problems they might encounter.",
	"Unfortunately, those carefree days are now coming to an end. Kai and Chris aren't kids anymore. They're both 18 year old heterosexuals of opposing sexes, and they can't keep pretending that they're just a couple of friends hanging out. Change is afoot, whether they're ready for it or not.",
	"Chris has been aware of this for a long time now, but Kai is only just starting to realize what's going on around him. The crushes he's had on other girls have faded, and it's finally dawned on him that his best friend is a member of the opposite sex. Tomboy or not, Chris's soft skin and adorable face make Kai's heart pound so loud that he can hear it. He's developing feelings for his best friend, or perhaps only just now realizing what he's felt all along.",
	"But before he can admit to his feelings, one obstacle still remains: his most recent and prominent crush, Sophie.",
	"At the same time that Kai starts to see Chris as a woman, Sophie suddenly begins to acknowledge his existence. She reaches out to him, confides in him, relies on him, and gives him all of the attention he craved from her for so long.",
	"Will the advances of Sophie, the busty, popular, well-liked girl whom Kai has been pining over for months, manage to sway his heart? Or will Kai accept that the friend right by his side since childhood was the perfect woman for him all along?",
	"No matter what actions Kai takes, Chris, in her justified frustration, has made one thing clear: tomboys need love too!"
