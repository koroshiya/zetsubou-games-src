story = [
	"Kai and Chris, who have been best friends since they were children, have reached the age where their feelings for one another are not so simple.",
	"As 18 year old heterosexuals of opposing sexes, the two have naturally begun to question the nature of their relationship. Where is the line drawn between being close friends and being a couple? If they aren't already a couple, could they one day have such a relationship? And most importantly, are their feelings mutual?",
	"For Chris, the more emotionally mature of the two, the answer is clear: they are just friends for now, but the next step forward is, without question, for them to become a couple. For Kai, however, it isn't so simple. He's only just starting to see Chris as a member of the opposite sex, and without some coaxing, his feelings won't change any time soon.",
	"Luckily for Chris, help is on the way. With Chris's parents overseas on business for the week, she will be staying over at Kai's house until they return, giving her more than enough time to make Kai realize that, tomboy or not, she is a beautiful young woman. Whether she's dazzling Kai with her culinary skills or seducing him with embarrassing displays of affection, Chris is sure that her plan will succeed, and before the week is up, they will be a couple at last.",
	"But before Chris can celebrate her victory, there is still one more obstacle that must be overcome: Sophie, Kai's most recent crush. Sophie is busty, popular, well-liked, and has been the object of Kai's affection for months. She is a proper young woman who possesses all of the qualities that Chris, the rowdy tomboy, does not.",
	"Usually this wouldn't be a problem, but with timing that couldn't possibly be a coincidence, Sophie has suddenly begun to show a very strong interest in Kai. Could the rumors about Sophie be true? Appearances aside, is she actually a predator with an extremely warped sense of love, who gets off by breaking up couples? Or are those just heinous rumors created out of malice and jealousy? Even if Kai seems to believe that they're all lies, Chris isn't so sure, and this difference of opinion will serve as one of the many wedges that Sophie's presence threatens to force between them.",
	"Will the advances of Sophie, the girl whom Kai has been pining over for months, manage to sway his heart? Or will Kai accept that the friend right by his side since childhood was the perfect woman for him all along?"

	"Kai",
	"Kai is an eighteen year old high school student with no particular goals or ambitions in life. He is still emotionally immature, and is not ready to live as an adult.

Conversely, Kai has a crush on Sophie, despite knowing very little about her, but lacks the courage to converse with her properly.",
	
	"tnlt/characters/chris.jpg",
	"Christine",
	"Chris is an eighteen year old girl who is considered by everyone around her to be a tomboy. She loves playing sports, and her biggest regret upon entering high school was that her best friend Kai stopped competing with her. Now that she's come of age, Chris can't decide whether she wants Kai to play with her like they used to, or to start seeing her as a girl.",
	
	"tnlt/characters/sophie.jpg",
	"Sophie",
	"A goddess to the boys, and an adversary to the girls. Sophie is simultaneously the most loved and hated girl in school. She acts kind and considerate towards others inside the classroom, yet there are many rumors circulating that she is a depraved man-stealer who believes in an exceedingly warped notion of love, and derives pleasure from ruining the relationships of others."
